>>### Super Counter Metronome ###<<

Hey there! Thanks for checking out the "Super Counter Metronome". This is just a
simple tool I threw together to help practice and improve Super Counter timing.
If you’ve ever struggled to consistently land Super Counters, this little program
should help you get more comfortable with the timing, especially when there’s no
game lag and you’re running in a stable 60 FPS environment.

This tool lets you visualize the timing windows where a Super Counter is possible
and also provides sound cues to help you nail those critical moments. It’s not perfect,
but from my testing, both offline and online (in the chaotic mess that is online play),
it’s been effective enough for getting the timing down.


### How It Works:
Super Counter Timing:
Super Counters need to be activated during very specific windows of time, and
this metronome helps you focus on those. Each full cycle of the metronome is
60 frames (or 1 second), with two windows where the Super Counter input is possible:

- First Window: Frames 21 to 28
- Second Window: Frames 42 to 49

The green zones on the progress bar represent these windows, and there are sound
cues to go along with them. The first sound plays on the 21st frame, which is
basically a decoy — it's the one you're most likely to miss because you also have
to factor in your opponent’s timing. The second sound, however, is your chance to
land the Super Counter and gain the upper hand.

Oh, and if you don’t want to stare at the screen the whole time, you can just run
this in the background and rely on the audio cues to practice the timing.

### Sound Cues:
- The sound is designed to play at the 21st frame as your first cue — you’ll probably
  miss this one due to all the variables involved, but that’s part of the process.
- The second sound (around the 45th frame) is where you should focus, as it’s your real
  opportunity to successfully perform the Super Counter input.

Of course, I MIGHT BE WRONG about the exact frame data or how the Super Counter
activates (game mechanics are tricky, and online play throws in its own complications
with lag, latency, etc), but based on my experience, this tool has helped me land
Super Counters much more reliably when the game isn’t lagging.

## How to Use:

1. Launch the Program: 
   - You’ll be taken to a customization menu where you can modify the color scheme
     (more on that later).
   
2. Customize Colors (Kind of...):
   - There’s an option to change the colors of the background, bar, and counter zones.
     But let me warn you: the color customization is a bit of a mess. I slapped it in
     at the last minute, and it barely works. The text boxes don’t behave properly, so
     don’t expect anything fancy here. It’s just there if you really want to mess with it.
   - After you’ve fiddled with the colors (or not), click START to begin the metronome.

3. Practice Mode:
   - A red bar moves across the screen from left to right over the course of 60 frames
     (1 second). The green sections represent the "Super Counter activation windows",
     and sound cues will play during each of those windows.
   - Your goal is to press the Super Counter input either slightly before, on, or slightly
     after the second sound to land the move during the second window.

4. Volume Slider:
   - There’s a volume slider at the bottom so you can adjust how loud the sound cues are.
     Feel free to tweak it to your liking.

will be over 9000!" If you find it useful, great! If not, well... it’s free. :)
